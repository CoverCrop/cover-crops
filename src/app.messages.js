"their fields to effectively manage cover crops. It will use existing and future research to demonstrate the potential" +
" of cover crops and help farmers manage the cover crops in their fields.  Better information, and functional" +
" assistance with management decision making, can, in turn, help increase successful adoption of this important " +
"practice.  Extensive research has found that adding cover crops to a field can improve soil health by, among other " +
"things, improving carbon, soil organic matter, water retention and weed suppression. Cover crops are also an important " +
"practice for the Illinois Nutrient Loss Reduction strategy because the growing cover crop can scavenge unused " +
"inorganic nitrogen and store it in the plantâ€™s biomass, reducing the amount lost.",
	"This tool will provide farmers, researchers, extension educators and others in the industry with data and information" +
	" about cover crops in a practical, visualized format. The tool will provide information about cover crop growth " +
	"integrated into common cropping systems, starting with cereal rye added to a corn-soybean rotation for fields in " +
	"Illinois. While fields outside of Illinois are currently not supported, they can be added in a future release.",
	"Funding for this project has been provided predominantly by the Illinois Nutrient Research & Education Council" +
	" (NREC) and the project team appreciates the financial, technical and other support from NREC.  Initial seed funding" +
	" for the project was also provided by the McKnight Foundation and the University of Illinois.  Forthcoming additional" +
	" features for the tool was funded by the Walton Family Foundation."
