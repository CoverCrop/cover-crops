#Cover Crop
A web-based decision support tool designed to help farmers manage cover crops in their fields


## Installation

1. Check that required JavaScript package manager `npm` and `Node.js` package
   are sucessfully installed on your computer

   `npm -v` and
   `node -v`

   Recommended versions to be used are: node 10.x and npm 6.x.

2. If not download `Node.js` package from, for example
   [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/) and install it on your system.
   Package manager `npm` is distributed with `Node.js` and it is automatically
   installed on your computer.
   
3. In the Project window terminal run (not mandatory in all environments)

   `npm install --python=python2.7`

   **Note:** Some `Node` installation dependencies do not work with Python 3.x
   therefore users with default higher version of Python have to specify lower
   Python versions.

## Running

1. In the Project window terminal run
   
   `export REACT_APP_ENV=development` (or production)
   
   `npm start`

2. The tool should open locally at

   `http://localhost:3000/`
